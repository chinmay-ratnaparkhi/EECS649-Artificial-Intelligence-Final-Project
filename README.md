# EECS649-Artificial-Intelligence-Final-Project
KU - Fall 2015 (Dr. Frank Brown)
  
  This project uses the A* algorithm to solve a given Sudoku puzzle. These
	*.java files can be compiled with the provided makefile and run by typing 
	"java Solver" in the terminal after compilation.
	
	The Solver requests a text file name to read the Start State to begin
	computation. 4 Test files (easy.txt, medium.txt, hard.txt and insane.txt) 
	are provided in the 'test' folder. These files can be loaded by entering
 	their names in the format : "xyz.txt" after running the Solver, since
 	
 	The Solver searches IN THE "TEST" FOLDER BY DEFAULT.

 	If additional test files need to be added, they can be added to the "test"
 	folder.
